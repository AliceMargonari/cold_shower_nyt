  <h1>How an Ice Bath May Undermine Your Weight Workout</h1>

<p> Bathtubs filled with frigid water and occasionally dotted with ice cubes are a common sight in professional athletes’ training rooms and at some gyms. Many recreational athletes also slip into cold baths at home after intense workouts. </p>

<p>But soaking in icy water after lifting weights can change how muscles respond to the workout and result in less muscle growth than doing nothing to recover, according to a cautionary new study of young men and their muscles. The study underscores that how we opt to recover from exercise may influence what we gain from the exercise and in sometimes unintended ways. </p>
<p> A <b> new study </b>, which was published this month in the Journal of Applied Physiology, scientists from Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia, Victoria University, also in Melbourne, and other institutions, decided to ask a group of volunteers to brave the discomforts of frigid water in inflatable bathtubs while the scientists tracked the state of their muscles. </p>

<p> The results from this study have showb that cold showers could even have <b> different implications for some exercisers </b>.</p>

<p>“If a person doesn’t want to build muscle,” Dr. Petersen says, then icy baths after lifting might be worthwhile. But for anyone hoping to grow both stronger and more muscular with gym workouts, he says, “based on our study and previous research, using cold-water immersion following weight training is not recommended.” </p>
